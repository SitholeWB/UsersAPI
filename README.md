# Introduction 
This is an API for registering and authenticating users. It uses JWT token and it supports different OAuth providers like Facebook, Google, etc. This can be useful if you planning to create a project using microservices and you need service to authorize users.

# Getting Started
Install Microsoft SQL Server and have dotnet development environment ready (i.e Visual studio). You must install dotnet core 3 or above.
You should be ready to run project from visual studio and swagger page will give you nice view of endpoints.

# Swagger Enabled
To explore and test the available APIs simply run the project and use the Swagger UI.

The available APIs include:
- Creates a new user.
- Authenticates a user.
- Protected controller for testing role-based authorization.

Enjoy!
